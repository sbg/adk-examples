Example ADK script that implements a parallelized version of a text file word counter. 
This example runs locally and does not depend on the Seven Bridges Platform for execution.

NOTE: To successfully run this script, you need to have the Seven Bridges RHEO Automation Development Kit (ADK) installed. Please contact Seven Bridges if you need access to the ADK.

### Run locally

Change directory into the `wordcount` subdirectory and type

```
python wordcount.py run --file_name words.txt
```

If successful, the following output should appear on your screen:
